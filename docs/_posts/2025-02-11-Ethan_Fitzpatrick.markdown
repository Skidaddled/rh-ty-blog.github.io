On Monday we havent done much but were given a breif explenation on Red Hat and what we were going to be doing here as well and a lesson on Linux and programming as a whole.
The lunch breaks are much better than my schools lunch breaks since i have time to settle and actually get food and drink into me!
Personally i loved it here as a whole with is being very enjoyable and all the staff here were very nice people. Felt strange at first not doing schoolwork but im getting used to it!

Today was an even better day, because we were both learning more about Red Hat and we had pizza which stuffed me up to where i didnt even hav dinner, and at 1 and we began doing our blog which was also very enjoyabe to do since it was easy to follow along and were going at a slow pace for us to be able to get things done and we were shown Github a website for programming and many other things.
Much better day than yesterday it feels like im not even in work experince but instead an after school club! Which is a nice change from the work bombing we get in school

On Wednesday we started with a little break at the start but we quickly got work on our blogs, we had a competition to make a rollercoaster out of paper straws, cups and paper with tape and that must have a loop in it. I was put in a smaller and less communicative team yet with out combined effort and planning we came out victorious by making a simple but creative 'coaster that was efficent and unique. since we used the straw box to help us make the coaster.
We also did a pasta challenge to make the marshmallow get as high as possible, my team unfortunatly lost both roundsdue to gravity not working in our favour but we got to eat marshmallows which is a win in my books.
overall this day was good, i enjoyed both challenges since they were fun and tested our patience, teamwork and mind.
